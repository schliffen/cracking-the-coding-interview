You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, la n d j . Write
a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.
That is, if M = 10011, you canassumethat there areat least 5 bits between j and i.
You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2,
because M could notfully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
